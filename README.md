Simple notetaking application is in progress of dev

## My philosophy


### Principles

- **==Resolution principle==** – each note *(except core links, outlines, plans)* contains only one idea.
    - Allows exact linkage.
- ==**Autonomous principle**== – each note must be clear, independent.
    - Allows the existence of basis for further linkage.
- ==**Graph principle**== – each created note must be linked to another one.
    - Allows the existence of network
- **==Occam's razor principle==**
    - Allows completeness and autonomy
- **==Deletion principle==** – each created note can not be deleted, only supplemented by a new one or be [[PALACE#^6db043|updated with a time division]].
    - Allows seeing the evolution of the network.
- **==Simple principle==** – each created note principally is a text.
    - Allows minimalistic united pattern of all notes and encourages using the [[PALACE]]
- ==**Absorbing principle**== – each created note must be written and copied if it is thought of understood.
    - Allows understanding of written ideas


		*The principles do work*

### Rules

- **Notes** can be listed, or even nested-listed, but each **question**, **item** **point** must have its **unique link**!  (*inconvenient for outlines*)
- **Date** + **time** can divide a note for updating ^6db043
- Weekly notes contain plans for the next week and thoughts of the past ^0caf0d
- [[PALACE]] can't be linked by any other notes (*except fundamental like [[START PAGE]]) ^07198f
- In **vault** directory must only be nothing except folders and [[PALACE]]. Other note are arranged into their special [[PALACE#Folders|folders]]. If there is no relevant [[PALACE#Folders|folder]] create and [[PALACE#^b7328e|#lige]] a new relevant one.

#### Note structure

##### Heading

{{date:ddd DD MMM}} {{date:YYYY}} at {{time:HH:mm:ss}}

##### Content

content

#### Tags

Tags are used to **navigate** some idea or work. I came to convenient use of tags, specifying each tag by name of problem and nesting them.

For example \#return/article_on_neuroscience – very simple, efficient, and useful

May use them in a little chaotic way..

But there are anyway some **stable** tags, which are always relevant:

#### Core Links

^e43a52
Core links listed here denote the meanings of most of the notes in the vault.
These links are placed in the relevant folders with the same name

- [[00 me]]
- [[00 management]]
- [[00 work]]
- [[00 zettelkasten]]

#### Zettelkasten notes

Zettel is very much convenient for notes with the [[PALACE#^118968|time linkage]] and for [[PALACE#^d2004a|notes with postfix]].

Zettelkasten taking note is needed for an instant thougth. By default, it is not connected no any other note. If needed, it can be connected to **daily note**.

Also Zettelkasten note has its **[[New zettelkasten note|unique title]]**.

##### Zettelkasten time notes

For instance some walks note:
^118968

- *Tretyakov gallery **2022 19 July 23 23 23***
- *sleep **2022 24 August 06 00 00***
- ==note name== ***zettelname (date)***

##### Zettelkasten defined postfixes
